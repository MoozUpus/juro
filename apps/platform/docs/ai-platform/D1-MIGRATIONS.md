# JURO D1 migrations

Updated: 2026-07-26  
Latest source migration: `0011_thankful_masked_marvel.sql`  
Remote application status: not applied.

## Migration policy

JURO uses additive expand-contract migrations. A remote migration requires:

1. verified external D1 protection;
2. recorded schema and application version;
3. local and staging compatibility checks;
4. an isolated restore rehearsal;
5. post-migration counts and foreign-key validation;
6. a documented application/config rollback.

Do not infer remote migration state from source files or a local Wrangler database.

## Migration 0011

`0011_thankful_masked_marvel.sql` adds seven tables without changing or deleting existing tables:

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `idempotency_keys` | Request-level idempotency records; queue execution uses its own lease/fencing model |
| `job_outbox` | IDs-only durable dispatch boundary with status, attempts, short lease, retry time, and fenced completion |
| `job_runs` | Queue delivery state, canonical envelope hash, tenant identifiers, attempts, short processing lease, retry time, and allowlisted error code |
| `scheduled_locks` | Future scheduled-operation overlap lock |
| `scheduled_runs` | Future deterministic scheduled-run ledger |
| `backup_runs` | Evidence ledger for requested/verified backups and restore tests |
| `cleanup_runs` | Dry-run-first cursor and scanned/deleted/failed counters |

No raw queue payload, prompt, document text, OCR, filename, email, token, object key, or provider error is stored in `job_runs`.

`backup_runs` includes fields for the D1 source bookmark, schema/app version, protected object reference, SHA-256 checksum, byte size, manifest version, verification time, and restore-test time. Empty fields do not constitute backup evidence.

## Local migration evidence

The SQLite-backed migration tests:

- derive migration 0011 from the Drizzle journal instead of relying on its generated adjective name;
- require every 0011 statement to be `CREATE TABLE`, `CREATE INDEX`, or `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX`;
- verify the journal and `0011_snapshot.json`;
- apply migrations `0000`–`0011` with foreign keys enabled;
- report zero `PRAGMA foreign_key_check` rows;
- apply `0000`–`0010`, insert a sentinel workspace, apply 0011, and prove the sentinel and every prior table definition remain unchanged;
- confirm that exactly seven tables are added.

The full local migration sequence changes the SQLite table count from 79 to 86. This is compatibility evidence for the checked-in migration sequence, not evidence about the live production schema.

## Staging procedure

After remote inventory and backup/restore gates:

1. record the staging D1 database ID and current migration ledger;
2. create and verify an external backup;
3. record its bookmark/checksum/manifest without storing secret values;
4. apply only pending migrations;
5. verify table/index presence and foreign keys;
6. run existing route/security tests and isolated document-builder/comparison smoke flows;
7. verify outbox/job lease behavior and Queue/DLQ delivery;
8. retain the backup until the release window and restore test are complete.

Production migration remains prohibited without explicit owner approval after all staging gates.
